        <p>This section should take about 2-3 months. After going through my book, training, and projects I will begin
            to learn the fine details and tricks for top of the line web-development.</p>
        <p>After I complete a couple of projects, I will create a certain pattern or workflow to be able to complete my
            projects efficiently.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>This section should take 2-3 months. After going through and learning from all of my resources I will begin
            to contruct new projects, and improve my projects from the first section.</p>
        <p>I want to make sure that for this section my projects have variety in function, since javscript has a greater
            variety
            of capabilities. </p>

        </ol>
        <p>This section will be less structured than the rest. After looking at a good amount of job postings and
            writing down the skill requirements, I will begin to explore, research, and apply said skills. This can be
            done in practice, new projects, or adding on to old projects.</p>
        <p>Some of the required skills listed on job postings will only require entry level knowledge so I will need to
            sort out which ones will require the most attention. </p>

            <li>Research People's Interview Experiences </li>
            <li>Get Github In Order</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This section should take 1-2 months. In order to complete these steps I will have to make use of different
            opinions and experiences. This will require me to gather information from a variety of sources. The third
            step will be the most important because it will be my first impression to the companies I'm applying to.</p>
        <p>It is very important that I go through all of my Github content and make sure there or no errors or typos and
            that it is my best work.</p>
        <p>Practice as many interivew questions as possible, just incase they throw you a curveball.</p>

            <li>Read Up And Practice Required Skills</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Finally, The last section! This could end up being the longest or the shortest section depending on when a
            company takes me in. It is important that during this process I am reviewing all that I've learned and
            planning for my next phase of learning. </p>
        <p>I MUST stick to the rule of applying at least 5 times a day and keep a positive attitude. I must also plan
            for the situation where I have to relocate in order to work. </p>
